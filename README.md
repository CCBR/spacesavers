> **Disk space**: _the final frontier_. This is the home of the cli, Spacesavers. Its long-term mission: to explore shared file systems, to seek duplicated files, and to boldly report disk space usage like no bot before!

## Overview

The **`./spacesaver`** command line tool is composed several inter-related sub commands to evaluate and optimize disk space usage across different shared group areas. Each of the available sub commands perform different functions analogous to common unix commands to optimize and report disk space usage: 

 * [<code>spacesaver <b>ls</b></code>](https://ccbr.github.io/spacesavers/usage/ls/): Recusively list directory contents to find duplicated files
 * [<code>spacesaver <b>df</b></code>](https://ccbr.github.io/spacesavers/usage/df/): Report disk space usage, duplication rate, and score path
 * [<code>spacesaver <b>ln</b></code>](https://ccbr.github.io/spacesavers/usage/ln/): Replace duplicated files with hard links to save disk space

Spacesavers can be utilized to recursively find duplicate files, report duplicated disk space usage, or replace duplicated files with hard links. Before getting started, we highly recommend reading through [spacesavers documentation](https://ccbr.github.io/spacesavers/).
